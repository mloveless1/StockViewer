Design for orders database:
 {Key = Date (mm-dd-yyyy format): {items :list with item names, Quantities: list with amount of each item ordered}

The quantities list will be ordered by the item ID's so, index 0 will be the quantities of chairs

Available items will pull all items with the selected date as the key, add up all of the quantities
and compare to the inventory database to show the available stock for that day
